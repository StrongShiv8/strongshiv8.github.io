Now lets see if I can have an exploit about this page →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%205.png)

Lets try this one →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%206.png)

Now its time to upload reverse shell code as a command injection →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%207.png)

Now in response I got the shell →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%208.png)

Now lets dig deeper into the Local Privilege Escalation →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%209.png)

user.txt → `427a7e47deb4a8649c7cab38df232b52`

Now after some recon I got these files with different permissions →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%2010.png)

Lets check `finally.sh` file which is basically executing the `write.sh` file .

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%2011.png)

Lets see `write.sh` file and lets upload a reverse shell code into this so that It can execute with the root permissions and I can have root shell !

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%2012.png)

Now I have to wait for 2-3 or 5 min for the cronjob to execute this file `finally.sh` as root →

And At last I got it what I wanted →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%2013.png)

Lets check root.txt file in /root →

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/Sar/Untitled%2014.png)

root.txt → `66f93d6b2ca96c9ad78a8a9ba0008e99`
