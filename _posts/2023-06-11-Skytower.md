## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**

>üí° 
    **Welcome to SkyTower:1**
<br><br>
**This CTF was designed by Telspace Systems for the CTF at the ITWeb Security Summit and BSidesCPT (Cape Town). The aim is to test intermediate to advanced security enthusiasts in their ability to attack a system using a multi-faceted approach and obtain the "flag".**<br>
<br>
**You will require skills across different facts of system and application vulnerabilities, as well as an understanding of various services and how to attack them. Most of all, your logical thinking and methodical approach to penetration testing will come into play to allow you to successfully attack this system. Try different variations and approaches. You will most likely find that automated tools will not assist you.**
<br><br>
**We encourage you to try it our for yourself first, give yourself plenty of time and then only revert to the Walkthroughs below.**
<br><br>
**Enjoy!**
