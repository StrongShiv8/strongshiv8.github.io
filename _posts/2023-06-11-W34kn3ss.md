## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**


üí° [W34kn3ss](https://vulnhub.com/entry/w34kn3ss-1,270/) ‚û°Ô∏è

The matrix is controlling this machine, neo is trying to escape from it and take back the control on it , your goal is to help neo to gain access as a ‚Äúroot‚Äù to this machine , through this machine you will need to perform a hard enumration on the target and understand what is the main idea of it , and exploit every possible ‚Äúweakness‚Äù that you can found , also you will be facing some upnormal behaviours during exploiting this machine.

This machine was made for Jordan‚Äôs Top hacker 2018 CTF , we tried to make it simulate a real world attacks ‚Äúas much as possible‚Äù in order to improve your penetration testing skills , also we but a little tricky techniques on it so you can learn more about some unique skills.

The machine was tested on vmware (player / workstation) and works without any problems , so we recommend to use VMware to run it , Also works fine using virtualbox.

**Difficulty:**<br> Intermediate , you need to think out of the box and collect all the puzzle pieces in order to get the job done.

The machine is already got DHCP enabled , so you will not have any problems with networking.

Happy Hacking !

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%203.png)

so after changing the `/etc/hosts` as nmap results says ‚Üí

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%207.png)

Now I have to follow the code so it says to Download some keys and I have already a key so lets follow the path ‚Üí

As I extracted it I got the `/rsa/2048/` directory then a bunch of keys so I copied mykey.pub into this folder .

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%208.png)

So When I extracted it ‚Üí

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%209.png)

After searching the content to the file I got this ‚Üí

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%2010.png)

Now lets try ssh with openssl private key which is found from the expoit directories ‚Üí

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%2011.png)

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%2012.png)

```bash
	user.txt ‚Üí 25e3cd678875b601425c9356c8039f68
```
{: .nolineno}

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%2013.png)

this means that the file is .pyc so let  is export it into attackers machine ‚Üí

![Untitled](/Vulnhub-Files/img/W34kn3ss/Untitled%2014.png)

From online python decompiler I got this ‚Üí

# **Summery Notes ‚Üí**

> ‚Üí Only tricky part was openssl public key and searching it with dictionary ‚Üí directories.
>
> ‚Üí After Shell ‚Üí `code` part which was .pyc python compiled part which was decompiled online.
> 
> ‚Üí Then got root password.
