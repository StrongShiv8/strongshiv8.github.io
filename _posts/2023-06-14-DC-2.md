## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**

>üí° [DC :2](https://vulnhub.com/entry/dc-2,311/) ‚û°Ô∏è
<br><br>
Much like DC-1, DC-2 is another purposely built vulnerable lab for the purpose of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br><br>
As with the original DC-1, it's designed with beginners in mind.
<br><br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br><br>
Just like with DC-1, there are five flags including the final flag.
<br><br>
And again, just like with DC-1, the flags are important for beginners, but not so important for those who have experience.
<br><br>
In short, the only flag that really counts, is the final flag.
<br><br>
For beginners, Google is your friend. Well, apart from all the privacy concerns etc etc.
<br><br>
I haven't explored all the ways to achieve root, as I scrapped the previous version I had been working on, and started completely fresh apart from the base OS install.
<br><br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br><br>
DC-2 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 32 bit, so there should be no issues running it on most PCs.
<br><br>
While I haven't tested it within a VMware environment, it should also work.
<br><br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br><br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox and away you go.
<br><br>
Please note that you will need to set the hosts file on your pentesting device to something like:
<br><br>
`192.168.0.145 dc-2`
<br><br>
Obviously, replace 192.168.0.145 with the actual IP address of DC-2.
<br><br>
It will make life a whole lot simpler (and a certain CMS may not work without it).
<br><br>
If you're not sure how to do this, instructions are here.
<br><br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br><br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br><br>
In saying that, there shouldn't be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br><br>
**CONTACT**
<br><br>
This is the second vulnerable lab challenge that I've created, so feel free to let me know what you think of it.
<br><br>
I'm also very interested in hearing how people go about solving these challenges, so if you're up for writing a , please do so and send me a link, or alternatively, follow me on Twitter, and DM me (you can unfollow after you've DM'd me if you'd prefer).

Let‚Äôs find the IP Address first >>

```bash
IP ‚Üí  10.0.2.7
```

## Web Enumeration ‚§µÔ∏è

![156-4.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-4.png)

WordPress 4.7.10

wpscan ‚Üí

![156-5.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-5.png)

![156-6.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-6.png)

![156-7.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-7.png)

Now generate the password using tool `cewl` ‚Üí

![156-8.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-8.png)

![156-9.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-9.png)

After bruteforcing the username as tom and password as generated from cewl Tool ‚Üí

```bash
tom : parturient
```

![156-10.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-10.png)

```bash
jerry : adipiscing
```

![156-11.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-11.png)

flag3.txt ‚Üí

![156-17.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-17.png)

flag4.txt ‚Üí

![156-13.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-13.png)

Now it is a restricted bash so I have to deal with it so lets see ‚Üí

I can use ls ‚Üí with that I can see many things  inside `/home/tom/usr/bin` ‚Üí

![156-14.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-14.png)

commands ‚Üí

```
1. vi
2. :set shell=/bin/bash
3. :shell

```

![156-16.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-16.png)

Now I can perform something ‚Üí

![156-18.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-18.png)

![156-19.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-19.png)

![156-20.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-20.png)

![156-21.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-2/156-21.png)

## Summery Notes ‚Üí

‚Üí The problem part was to get rid from restrictive bash

‚Üí When I knew what to do ,To do so it was like holy shit !!

‚Üí set all was shit.
