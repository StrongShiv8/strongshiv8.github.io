## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**

>üí° [DC-3](https://vulnhub.com/entry/dc-32,312/) is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
As with the previous DC releases, this one is designed with beginners in mind, although this time around, there is only one flag, one entry point and no clues at all.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
<br>
For those with experience doing CTF and Boot2Root challenges, this probably would not take you long at all (in fact, it could take you less than 20 minutes easily).
<br>
If that is the case, and if you want it to be a bit more of a challenge, you can always redo the challenge and explore other ways of gaining root and obtaining the flag.
<br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br>
DC-3 is a VirtualBox VM built on Ubuntu 32 bit, so there should be no issues running it on most PCs.
<br>
Please note: There was an issue reported with DC-3 not working with VMware Workstation. To get around that, I recommend using VirtualBox, however, I have created a separate DC-3 VMware edition for those who can only use VMware.
<br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox and away you go.
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br>
In saying that, there should not be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br>
**CONTACT**
<br>
I'm also very interested in hearing how people go about solving these challenges, so if you're up for writing a , please do so and send me a link, or alternatively, follow me on Twitter, and DM me (you can unfollow after you've DM'd me if you'd prefer).
<br>
I can be contacted via Twitter - @DCAU7
<br>
This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware ## Changelog v3.2 - 2020-04-25 v3.0 - 2019-03-26
