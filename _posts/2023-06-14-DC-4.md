## **Description ⤵️**

>**💡 [DC-4](https://vulnhub.com/entry/dc-4,313/)** is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
Unlike the previous DC releases, this one is designed primarily for beginners/intermediates. There is only one flag, but technically, multiple entry points and just like last time, no clues.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
<br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br>
DC-4 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 32 bit, so there should be no issues running it on most PCs.
<br>
If there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of this.
<br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox and away you go.
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br>
In saying that, there should not be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br>
**CONTACT**
<br>
I'm also very interested in hearing how people go about solving these challenges, so if you're up for writing a , please do so and send me a link, or alternatively, follow me on Twitter, and DM me (you can unfollow after you've DM'd me if you'd prefer).

with teehee command works similar like tee so I am going to add a user with root permissions →

```bash
commands → shiva::0:0:::/bin/bash → with no passwords set
```

Summery Notes →

→ **NOTE** → `tee` or `teehee -a /etc/passwd`

→ Then adding a null user with no password **but as a root was very nice move**.
