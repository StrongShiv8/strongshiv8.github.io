## **Description ⤵️**

>
**💡 [DC-6](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-6,315/)** is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
This is not an overly difficult challenge so should be great for beginners.
<br>
The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
<br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br>
DC-6 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 64 bit, but there should not be any issues running it on most PCs.
<br>
I have tested this on VMWare Player, but if there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of this.
<br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox or VMWare and away you go.
<br>
<span style="color:#fd77f8">NOTE: You WILL need to edit your hosts file on your pentesting device so that it reads something like:</span>
<br>
`192.168.0.142 wordy`
<br>
<span style="color:#fd77f8">NOTE: I've used 192.168.0.142 as an example. You'll need to use your normal method to determine the IP address of the VM, and adapt accordingly.</span>
<br>
This is VERY important.
<br>
And yes, it is another WordPress based VM (although only my second one).
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br>
In saying that, there should not be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br>
**CONTACT**
<br>
I'm also very interested in hearing how people go about solving these challenges, so if you're up for writing a , please do so and send me a link, or alternatively, follow me on Twitter, and DM me (you can unfollow after you've DM'd me if you'd prefer).
<br>
I can be contacted via Twitter - @DCAU7
<br>
**CLUE**
<br>
OK, this is not really a clue as such, but more of some "we do not want to spend five years waiting for a certain process to finish" kind of advice for those who just want to get on with the job.
<br>
<span style="color:#fd77f8">cat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep k01 > passwords.txt</span> That should save you a few years. ;-)
