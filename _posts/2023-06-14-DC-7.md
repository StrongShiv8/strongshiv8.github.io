## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**

>**üí° [DC-7](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-7,356/)** is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
While this is not an overly technical challenge, it is not exactly easy.
<br>
While it is kind of a logical progression from an earlier DC release (I would not tell you which one), there are some new concepts involved, but you will need to figure those out for yourself. :-) If you need to resort to brute forcing or dictionary attacks, you probably would not succeed.
<br>
What you will need to do, is to think "outside" of the box.
<br>
Waaaaaay "outside" of the box. :-)
<br>
The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
<br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br>
DC-7 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 64 bit, but there should not be any issues running it on most PCs.
<br>
I have tested this on VMWare Player, but if there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of¬†[this](http://www.five86.com/vmware.html).
<br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox or VMWare and away you go.
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br>
In saying that, there should not be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br>
**CONTACT**
<br>
I'm also very interested in hearing how people go about solving these challenges, so if you're up for writing a , please do so and send me a link, or alternatively, follow me on Twitter, and DM me (you can unfollow after you've DM'd me if you'd prefer).

### Let‚Äôs find the IP Address first >>

```bash
IP ‚Üí  10.0.2.13
```
{: .nolineno}

## Port Scan Results ‚û°Ô∏è

![161-2.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-2.png)

```bash
OPEN PORTS >
22   SSH
80   HTTP

## Web Enumeration ‚§µÔ∏è

I checked port 80 and found this `drupal` site.

![161-3.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-3.png)

I got `Drupal 8.7.6` version of drupal site so lets exploit this version further more.

![161-4.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-4.png)

Mean while I got this user from this site below `@DC7USER`.

![161-5.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-5.png)

Lets look into it on web ‚Üí

On web, I did some reconnaissance and got this github repo ‚Üí

![161-6.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-6.png)

![161-7.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-7.png)

![161-8.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-8.png)

![161-9.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-9.png)

```bash
dc7user : MdR3xOgB7#dW
```
{: .nolineno}

Now lets try SSH login ‚Üí

### SHELL ‚û°Ô∏è

![161-10.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-10.png)

Lets dig deeper inside the shell ‚Üí

![161-11.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-11.png)

I also found something in mail ‚Üí

![161-12.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-12.png)

![161-13.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-13.png)

from above script of `sql-dump` when I enumerated further on web I got this ‚Üí

![161-14.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-14.png)

Now lets try it out ‚Üí

![161-15.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-15.png)

Now lets login using this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è credentials ‚Üí

![161-16.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-16.png)

Now I am admin so lets find a way to get the shell ‚Üí

For enabling for reverse shell I need to follow certain steps ‚Üí

<kbd>Manage</kbd> > <kbd>Extend</kbd> > <kbd>List</kbd> > <kbd>Install new module</kbd>

![161-17.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-17.png)

![161-18.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-18.png)

![161-19.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-19.png)

Now ‚Üí

<kbd>Manage</kbd> > <kbd>Extend</kbd> > <kbd>filter</kbd>

![161-20.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-20.png)

Then click Install ‚Üí

Now reverse shell upload time ‚Üí

![161-21.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-21.png)

As I clicked on preview or save button my nc triggered ‚Üí

![161-22.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-22.png)

Now I uploaded again a shell for root ‚Üí

![161-23.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-23.png)

![161-24.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-24.png)

lets wait and see the results as ‚Üí

![161-25.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-25.png)

![161-26.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-7/161-26.png)

## Summery Notes ‚û°Ô∏è

‚Üí Very Interesting machine in terms of OSINT

‚Üí and the reverse shell upload process for drupal is from web.

‚Üí then rest all about keen eyes for commands / code / directions /permissions.
