## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**

>**üí° [DC-8](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-8,367/)** is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
This challenge is a bit of a hybrid between being an actual challenge, and being a "proof of concept" as to whether two-factor authentication installed and configured on Linux can prevent the Linux server from being exploited.
<br>
The "proof of concept" portion of this challenge eventuated as a result of a question being asked about two-factor authentication and Linux on Twitter, and also due to a suggestion by @theart42.
<br>
The ultimate goal of this challenge is to bypass two-factor authentication, get root and to read the one and only flag.
<br>
You probably would not even know that two-factor authentication was installed and configured unless you attempt to login via SSH, but it is definitely there and doing it is job.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.

### Let‚Äôs find the IP Address first >>

```bash
IP : 10.0.2.14
```
{: .nolineno}

## Port Scan Results ‚û°Ô∏è

## Web Enumeration ‚§µÔ∏è

I checked port 80 and got this drupal site.

![162-3.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-3.png)

Again Drupal ‚Üí

Lets look into the directory traversal files with `ffuf` Tool ‚Üí

![162-4.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-4.png)

So it contains `pgsql` so lets try `sqli` ‚Üí

![162-5.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-5.png)

As I got to know that there is a database name `d7db` so lets see what it got ‚Üí

![162-6.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-6.png)

With `Sqlmap` Tool ,I got these much tables on `d7db` database ‚Üí

![162-7.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-7.png)

Lets check the users.csv files ‚Üí

```bash
admin,$S$D2tRcYRyqVFNSc0NvYUrYeQbLQg5koMKtihYTIDC9QQqJi3ICg5z

john,$S$DqupvJbxVmqjr6cYePnx2A891ln7lsuku/3if/oRVZJaz5mKC2vF
```
{: .nolineno}

Lets use john the ripper to crack this ‚Üí

The `password.hash` contains the password hashes of users ‚Üí

![162-8.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-8.png)

```bash
turtle
```
{: .nolineno}

![162-9.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-9.png)

Now Lets perform these steps to achieve reverse shell ‚Üí

<kbd>Contact Us</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>WEBFORM</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Form Settings</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>upload php reverse shell code</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Save Configurations</kbd>.

ADD something before the PHP code like any string .

![162-11.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-11.png)

### SHELL ‚û°Ô∏è

Now after getting the shell lets try SUIDS and GUIDS files ‚Üí

![162-12.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-12.png)

Now lets exploit `exim4` ‚Üí

![162-13.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-13.png)

![162-14.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-14.png)

this exim code got 2 commands 1 for setuid and the 2nd one for netcat and that I used it ‚Üí

![162-15.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-15.png)

![162-16.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-16.png)

![162-17.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-8/162-17.png)
