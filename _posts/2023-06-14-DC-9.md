## **Description ⤵️**

>
**💡 [DC-9](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-9,412/)** is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
<br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br>
DC-9 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 64 bit, but there should not be any issues running it on most PCs.
<br>
DC-9 has been tested successfully on VMWare Player, but if there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of [this](http://www.five86.com/vmware.html).
<br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox or VMWare and away you go.
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br>
In saying that, there should not be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br>

### Let’s find the IP Address first >>

![163-1.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-1.png)

```bash
IP : 10.0.2.15
```
{: .nolineno}

## Port Scan Results ➡️

![163-2.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-2.png)

```bash
OPEN PORTS >
80   HTTP
Filtered PORT >
22   SSH (I think I have to open it through knocking ports )
```
{: .nolineno}

## Web Enumeration ⤵️

I will be enumerating port 80 first and I got to this drupal static site.

![163-3.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-3.png)

![163-4.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-4.png)

Now lets deal with search.php file from burpsuite →

![163-5.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-5.png)

Now save this request as `results.txt` and used `Sqlmap` Tool to figure out the sqli type and to extract some data →

![163-6.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-6.png)

![163-7.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-7.png)

lets dig deeper →

```sql
command :
sqlmap -r results.txt -D Staff -T Users -
```
{: .nolineno}

![163-8.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-8.png)

```sql
admin : transorbital1
```
{: .nolineno}

![163-9.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-9.png)

![163-10.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-10.png)

After login with admin credentials I got this page → which says file not exist.

![163-11.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-11.png)

I got LFI on `welcome.php` page.

![163-12.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-12.png)

Now lets check for knocked ports which will open ssh port on **`/etc/knockd.conf`** →

![163-13.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-13.png)

Lets knock the ports →

```bash
sudo knock 100.2.16 7469 8475 9842
```
![163-14.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-14.png)

Now lets check the result with scanning the network again with `nmap` Tool →

![163-15.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-15.png)

Now lets try hydra for ssh brute-force →

I have saved username , passwords that I got from the sqli →

![163-16.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-16.png)

```bash
chandlerb : UrAG0D!

joeyt : Passw0rd

janitor : Ilovepeepee
```
{: .nolineno}

### SHELL ➡️

![163-17.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-17.png)

I got some new passwords !

![163-18.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-18.png)

Now use this password to ssh again for any other results →

![163-19.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-19.png)

```bash
fredf : B4-Tru3-001
```
{: .nolineno}

![163-20.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-20.png)

![163-21.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-21.png)

![163-22.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-22.png)

Since this file is reading the content of a file and writing on another file →

So lets append a password inside the `/etc/passwd` file →

![163-23.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-23.png)

![163-24.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-24.png)

![163-25.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-25.png)

![163-26.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-26.png)

![163-27.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-27.png)
