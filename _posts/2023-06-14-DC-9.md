## **Description ‚§µÔ∏è**

>
üí° [DC-9](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-9,412/) is another purposely built vulnerable lab with the intent of gaining experience in the world of penetration testing.
<br>
The ultimate goal of this challenge is to get root and to read the one and only flag.
<br>
Linux skills and familiarity with the Linux command line are a must, as is some experience with basic penetration testing tools.
<br>
For beginners, Google can be of great assistance, but you can always tweet me at @DCAU7 for assistance to get you going again. But take note: I would not give you the answer, instead, I'll give you an idea about how to move forward.
<br>
**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**
<br>
DC-9 is a VirtualBox VM built on Debian 64 bit, but there should not be any issues running it on most PCs.
<br>
DC-9 has been tested successfully on VMWare Player, but if there are any issues running this VM in VMware, have a read through of¬†[this](http://www.five86.com/vmware.html).
<br>
It is currently configured for Bridged Networking, however, this can be changed to suit your requirements. Networking is configured for DHCP.
<br>
Installation is simple - download it, unzip it, and then import it into VirtualBox or VMWare and away you go.
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
<br>
While there should be no problems using this VM, by downloading it, you accept full responsibility for any unintentional damage that this VM may cause.
<br>
In saying that, there should not be any problems, but I feel the need to throw this out there just in case.
<br>

### Let‚Äôs find the IP Address first >>

![163-1.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-1.png)

```bash
IP : 10.0.2.15
```

## Port Scan Results ‚û°Ô∏è

![163-2.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-2.png)

```bash
OPEN PORTS >
80   HTTP
Filtered PORT >
22   SSH (I think I have to open it through knocking ports )
```

## Web Enumeration ‚§µÔ∏è

![163-3.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-3.png)

![163-4.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-4.png)

Now lets deal with search.php file from burpsuite ‚Üí

![163-5.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-5.png)

Now save this request as results.txt and use sqlmap to figure out the sql type with data ‚Üí

![163-6.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-6.png)

![163-7.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-7.png)

lets dig deeper ‚Üí

```sql
command :
sqlmap -r results.txt -D Staff -T Users -
```

![163-8.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-8.png)

```sql
admin : transorbital1
```

![163-9.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-9.png)

![163-10.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-10.png)

After login with admin credentials I got this page ‚Üí which says file not exist.

![163-11.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-11.png)

![163-12.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-12.png)

Now lets check for knocked ports which will open ssh port on **/etc/knockd.conf** ‚Üí

![163-13.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-13.png)

Lets knock the ports ‚Üí

![163-14.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-14.png)

Now lets check the result ‚Üí

![163-15.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-15.png)

Now lets try hydra for ssh brute-force ‚Üí

I have saved username , passwords in different files ‚Üí

![163-16.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-16.png)

```bash
chandlerb : UrAG0D!

joeyt : Passw0rd

janitor : Ilovepeepee
```

### SHELL ‚û°Ô∏è

![163-17.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-17.png)

![163-18.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-18.png)

Now use this password to ssh again for any other results ‚Üí

![163-19.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-19.png)

```bash
fredf : B4-Tru3-001
```

![163-20.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-20.png)

![163-21.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-21.png)

![163-22.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-22.png)

Since this file is reading the content of a file and writing on another file ‚Üí

So lets append a password inside the `/etc/passwd` file ‚Üí

![163-23.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-23.png)

![163-24.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-24.png)

![163-25.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-25.png)

![163-26.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-26.png)

![163-27.png](/Vulnhub-Files/img/DC-9/163-27.png)

## Summery Notes ‚§µÔ∏è

‚Üí Very much hurdle came like **sqlmap with request , knocking , test.py**
