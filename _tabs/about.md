## Introduction ⤵️

I am a Cyber Security Learner, and I usually practice on different fields like **Tryhackme**, **Hackthebox**, **Proving Ground Play**, **Proving Ground Practice**, and **Vulnhub** sites. Currently, I am enhancing my knowledge in the **Red Teaming field**, and I had an internship from **Gurugram Cyber Cell Police** in 2022. I graduated from **GLA University** with a specialization in **Cyber Security and Forensics** in the year 2022.

Apart from cyber security, I am interested in web development and automation using various programming languages. I have worked with Python, JavaScript, Shell Scripting, HTML/CSS, and SQL. In my spare time, I like to play online CTF games and add to my knowledge.
