## Introduction ⤵️

I am a Cyber Security Learner, and I usually practice on different fields like Tryhackme, Hackthebox, Proving Ground Play, and Vulnhub sites. Currently, I am preparing for the OSCP Examination, and I had an internship from Gurugram Cyber Cell Police in 2022. I graduated from GLA University with a specialization in Cyber Security and Forensics in the year 2022.

Besides cyber security, I also have interests in automation stuff with different programming languages and web development. I have experience in Python, JavaScript, Shell Scripting , HTML/CSS, and SQL. In my free time, I enjoy participating in online CTF competitions and contributing to my leanings as well.
